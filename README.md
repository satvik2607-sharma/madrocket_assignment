Features I was able to implement:
1. Creating a login/register form for subhash and vendors
2. Authentication system with email/password done using Google Firebase
3. Home Screen layout containing three dropdown for adding inventory of each item
4. seperate logout button present on appbar so that user can easily logout along with alert dialog box for the confirmation

Features I was not able to implement:
1. Passing the data of inventory from subash app to vendor app.
2. Notifications system as soon as the inventory level is set to low
